<title>Caching</title>

<para>Grammar parsing can be time consuming, but after development is
finished, they change infrequently.
<application>CoffeePot</application> can automatically cache compiled
versions of grammars and use them automatically if they are
up-to-date (based on last modified time).</para>

<para>(You can do this manually, by saving the compiled grammars and loading
them explicitly, but using a cache saves a little time and effort.)</para>

<para>The location of cached grammars is controlled by <link
linkend="config.cache">cache</link> setting in the configuration file.
If the cache is a relative location (such as
<code>.grammar-cache</code>), the compiled grammars are stored in the
cache with the same filename as the original grammar except that the
extension is changed. If the location is absolute (begins with a "/";
such as <code>/home/user/.config/nineml/grammar-cache</code>), the
name of the cached file is a cryptographic hash of the original
absolute filename.</para>

<para>The cache directory must be configured; if it's unconfigured, no
caching is performed.</para>
