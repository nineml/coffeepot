# CoffeePot, an Invisible XML processor

This repository contains an example command-line [Invisible XML](https://invisiblexml.org/) processor
built on top of the [CoffeeGrinder](https://github.com/nineml/coffeegrinder) and
[CoffeeFilter](https://github.com/nineml/coffeefilter) projects.

Build automation, etc. to come. In the meantime, you can build it with `./gradlew jar` and run it with `java -jar build/libs/coffeepot-0.1.0.jar`

Running it without any options will print a usage message. Documentation to follow as well.
